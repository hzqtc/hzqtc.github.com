So I decided to start blog in English, but only about technical stuffs. Actually, I've been thinking of blog in English for quite a long time. I setup this new English blog so English posts won't be mixed up with my existed Chinese posts. I'll translate some prominent posts from my [Chinese Blog](http://johnny-huang.appspot.com/) and post them here.

The blog you see is a static site generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). The [source code](https://github.com/hzqtc/hzqtc.github.com) and the site itself are both hosted on GitHub. I build this blog basically based on [mojombo's](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com) because it's very simple and clean. I am gonna to add some features such as *Categories*, *Tags*, *Archives* and *Comments* later.

As you can see, this blog is hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). It is a perfect host for static sites such as a blog or a project's home page. The most exciting thing is that everything is managed by Git and synced with your GitHub repositories. No database, admin pages or data backup is needed. The only problem is to deal with the User Generated Content such as blog comments, but that can be solved by using external comment service from [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).
